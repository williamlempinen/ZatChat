# ZatChat

> This project is not ready, thus not fully working.

Simple React project where I use WebSockets to implement basic chatting features.

Server uses Express NodeJs

### Short demo

![](https://github.com/williamlempinen/ZatChat/raw/main/zatchat_demo1.gif)


Development app is available in [zatchat.xyz](https://zatchat.xyz), which contains a lot of dev "features", such as plain text passwords and not working messaging. 

There exists two users with credentials of:

| Email | Password | 
|----------|----------|
| william@example.com | william123 |
| kaveri@example.com | kaveri123 | 


### todo

- real-time handling of unread messages with websocket
- fix auth/apiClient
- change theme
- user's contacts are undefined on right after login
- hosting
